## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

ShaderViewController is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'ShaderViewController'
```

Actually... It's not available that way yet. It'll be in the near future.

For now just copy ShaderVC.swift from the repo and use that to have a ViewController which has a shader running.
For shaders look at the accompanying ShaderEditor for iOS called 'Shaders - Shader editor'
